# PoshBoolAlgebra

A PowerShell module for generating truth tables based on a logical expression that may contain operators like AND, OR, EQV, IMP and NOT.

The output is either a custom object or **Html** (I will add some CSS in the near future)

A must for any administrator;) (NOT!)

But it can be fun for people who have to learn these kind of things for their studies. And as always even PowerShell experts might learn something new like how to use generic collections or write a tiny expression parser.
